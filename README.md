- 👋 Hi, I’m Josh
- 👀 I’m interested in all things full stack development. Front, back, APIs, databses, you name it!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Ruby (RoR), more in depth Firebase functionality, and trying to get a better understanding of the best online payment APIs available.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects involving e-commerce, online checkout, or anything involving current front-end framewroks, like: React, Angular, Vue, etc.
- 📫 To get in touch with me, please take a look at my personal website: https://joshwintraub.com, or reach out through LinkedIn.
