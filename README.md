- 👋  Hi, I’m Josh, a software engineer. Thanks for stopping by my profile.
- 👀  I’m interested in all things full stack development. Front, back, APIs, databses, you name it!
- 🌱  I’m currently learning Ruby (RoR), more in depth Firebase functionality, and trying to get a better understanding of the best online payment APIs available.
- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving e-commerce, online checkout, and projects using current front-end framewroks, like: React, Angular, Vue, etc.
